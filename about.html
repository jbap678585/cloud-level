            Hello, I'm JBAP.
            I got interested in a game called "Level Maker" in 2020. I've always dreamed of online multiplayer appearing in that game. It never came true. 
            About 3 years later, I began working on "Cloud Level" - which is a Scratch Project! I've learned I could combine 3 griffpatch tutorials into one project and a bit of Level Maker sprites. It was done,
            But I don't want to be called lazy. So, instead of being lazy, I started tweaking the code, adding new features (Custom User IDs for example). I think it was a good decision!
            I published 6 versions of that game. Each having its own gimmick. I unshared all of these from Scratch, 6 months (maybe) after Cloud Level's release, because it had text-based chats.
            You can type messages here instead of selecting pre-selected phrases. I'm not saying I'm the guy that invented all of this and that. I'm just me.
